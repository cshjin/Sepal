### Learning Torch

* Download Torch and install: http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html
* Learn Lua: http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/
* Learn basic Torch: 
  * https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet#tutorials
  * https://github.com/torch/tutorials/blob/master/1_get_star
  * https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Torch.ipynb
* Skim through the fundamentals of tensor and math operations:
  * Tensor manipulation: https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/tensor.md
  * Math operations: https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/maths.md
  Make sure you understand the _in-place_ construction and resulting savings in computation. Torch is obsessed with performance!
* Work on machine learning!
  * Walk through the tuturials 1-5: https://web.archive.org/web/20160201031326/http://code.madbits.com/wiki/doku.php  
  * The associated code for the tutorial can be obtained from https://github.com/torch/tutorials  
  * Some equations on web.archive.org cannot be displaed well. In such cases, go to the correspondign sections at https://github.com/clementfarabet/ipam-tutorials/tree/master/th_tutorials and you will find the LaTeX code there.
