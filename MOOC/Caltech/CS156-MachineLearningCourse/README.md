## Resource

* Prof. Hsuan-Tien Lin (林軒田), who is a formal student of Prof. Abu-Mostafa, offered a similar course on National Taiwan University. Videos captured in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/hsuantien). Also it offers on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ntumlone).

* textbook: [Learning from Data](http://amlbook.com/), which is thin and easy to read for beginners.

I will keep adding my personal notes when I go through this lectures.
